Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters:
Question:
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Solution:

class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        int l=0,r=0;
        int n=s.size();
        int length=0;
        vector<int>mpp(256,-1);
        while(r<n){
            if(mpp[s[r]]!=-1){
                if(mpp[s[r]]>=l){
                    l=mpp[s[r]]+1;
                }
            }
        mpp[s[r]]=r;
        length=max(length,r-l+1);
        r++;         
        }
        return length;
    }
};
